# Dictionary-based-Code-Compression-De-Compression

Dictionary based code compression and de-compression for embedded applications

Implemented static dictionary (16 entries) based compression. Dictionary elements selected based on the frequency. Used code compression strategies like bitmask-based (4bit), consecutive mismatches (1bit, 2bit, 4bit) and run-length encoding. Optimal compression strategy selected based on the number of bits saved.
